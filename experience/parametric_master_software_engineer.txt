Master Software Engineer

September 2013

Senior software developer, leader, and team manager responsible for directing Parametric's systems architecture, mentoring, and evangelizing of good practices across the organization.  I design or implement enterprise wide systems using technologies such as RabbitMQ, WCF, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and Couchbase.  

In addition to systems design, I mentor junior members of the organization and directly lead a team of 4-5 software developers and QA professionals responsible for producing high quality implementations of these systems.  Also manage junior and mid level developers.

Believing that the hardest part about building good software is finding the right people, I have also built up highly coherent, effective teams while fostering a close relationship with the varying product owners.
