I'm a software developer with over 10 years of experience in building software for startups, smaller businesses, and large corporations. During this time I have worked in all different facets of the industry in roles such as developer, software architect, team lead, QA, business analyst, and DevOps. From this, I have learned that building good software is as much about people as it is about technical challenges.

I have experience working in teams and on my own, both with the end result of delivering an exceptional product. 

If you need work done, chances are I can do it.
