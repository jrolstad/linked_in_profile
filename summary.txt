I have over 10 years of experience delivering quality software, building strong teams, and leading others in different environments from startups to large corporations.

During this time I have worked in all different facets of the industry from roles such as software developer, software architect, team lead, QA, business analyst, mentor, and group leader. From this, I have learned that building good software is as much about people as it is about technical challenges.

I have experience working in teams and on my own, both with the end result of delivering an exceptional, quality product. 

If you need work done, I can do it or build and lead a team that can.
